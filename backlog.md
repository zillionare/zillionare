## Engineering and Interviewing at HRT

We do now have a much wider variety of engineering jobs, which, generally speaking, is a good thing. But it can be a little difficult for someone interested in engineering at HRT to figure out what exactly is happening internally and where they may best fit. I’ve found myself repeatedly giving the same “spiel” during interviews, and I figured it’d make sense to just write it down so everyone has access to the same information. The remainder of this post should help you get a better mental model of the topology of engineering at HRT and then explain how to approach the interview. Please keep in mind that I cannot possibly address every specialty at HRT in a single blog post. So if you have a skill set that would work at HRT and it’s not explicitly mentioned here, please still apply, and our recruiting team will help you find the right fit.
