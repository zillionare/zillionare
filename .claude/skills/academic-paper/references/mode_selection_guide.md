## Detailed Description of Each Mode

### full mode — Complete Paper Writing

**Applicable Scenarios**:
- User has a clear research question and (partial) materials
- Needs to produce a complete paper from start to finish
- Includes all phases: Interview → Literature → Structure → Argumentation → Writing → Citation → Review → Formatting

**Not Applicable When**:
- User has no idea about research direction (→ use `deep-research` first)
- Only need a specific section (→ use another specialized mode)

**Expected Output**: Complete paper draft + references + bilingual abstract + review report
**Expected Duration**: Long (all 8 Phases fully executed)
**Agents Used**: All 9 + socratic_mentor (if needed)

---

### outline-only mode — Outline Generation

**Applicable Scenarios**:
- Only need the paper structure and outline
- A proposal to submit to an advisor for review
- Need to quickly plan the paper structure

**Not Applicable When**:
- Need complete paper content (→ full mode)
- Need guided thinking (→ plan mode)

**Expected Output**: Detailed outline + evidence allocation + word count distribution
**Expected Duration**: Short (Phase 0-2)
**Agents Used**: intake → literature_strategist → structure_architect

---

### plan mode — Chapter-by-Chapter Guided Planning ★ NEW

**Applicable Scenarios**:
- User has ideas but they are not yet clear enough

- First-time academic paper writer
- Wants to think through every section before writing
- Just received materials from deep-research and needs to transform them into a paper plan

**Not Applicable When**:
- Already knows exactly what to write (→ full mode is faster)
- Only needs an outline without deep thinking (→ outline-only mode)

**Expected Output**: Chapter Plan + INSIGHT Collection
**Expected Duration**: Medium (Step 0-3, approximately 20-30 rounds of conversation)
**Agents Used**: intake → socratic_mentor → structure_architect → argument_builder

**Subsequent Connections**:
- Chapter Plan → full mode (produce complete paper)

---

### abstract-only mode — Abstract Writing

**Applicable Scenarios**:

## Paths from deep-research

```
deep-research completed
  │
  ├── deep-research (full mode) outputs:
  │   RQ Brief + Methodology Blueprint + Annotated Bibliography + Synthesis Report
  │   │
  │   ├── Want to write the paper directly ──→ academic-paper (full mode)
  │   │   intake_agent auto-detects materials, skips redundant questions
  │   │
  │   └── Want to plan before writing ──→ academic-paper (plan mode)
  │       socratic_mentor leverages existing materials to accelerate guidance
  │
  └── deep-research (socratic mode) outputs:
      INSIGHT Collection + Synthesis Report
      │
      ├── INSIGHTs are sufficiently clear ──→ academic-paper (full mode)
      │
      └── Need more guidance ──→ academic-paper (plan mode)
          socratic_mentor continues deepening from INSIGHTs
```

## Connecting to academic-paper-reviewer

```
academic-paper completed
  │
  ├── full mode produces complete paper ──→ academic-paper-reviewer (full / guided)
  │   Complete peer review + revision suggestions
  │
  ├── plan mode produces Chapter Plan ──→ academic-paper-reviewer (guided)
  │   Review the plan's feasibility and completeness
  │
  └── reviewer feedback ──→ academic-paper (revision mode)
      Revise paper based on review comments

## Common Misselection Scenarios

| User Says | Easily Misselected | Correct Choice | Reason |
|---------|---------|---------|------|
| "Help me write an outline" / 「幫我寫大綱」 | outline-only | First confirm: Do they want a simple outline or deep planning? | May need plan mode |
| "I want to write a paper but don't know how to start" / 「想寫論文但不知道怎麼開始」 | full | plan mode | Needs guided thinking |
| "Help me revise my paper" / 「幫我修改論文」 | revision | First confirm: Are there reviewer comments? | May need full mode rewrite |
| "Help me search for literature" / 「幫我找文獻」 | lit-review | First confirm: Is it a literature review for a paper or a research investigation? | May need deep-research |
| "I have deep-research results, help me write a paper" / 「我有研究結果，幫我寫成論文」 | full (skip Phase 0 directly) | full (but intake needs to detect handoff) | Materials need to be properly imported |
| "I want to plan my paper step by step" / 「我想逐步規劃論文」 | outline-only | plan mode | Needs interactive guidance |
| "The paper format is wrong" / 「論文格式不對」 | revision | citation-check or format-convert | May only need format correction |
| 「帶我寫論文」/「引導我寫論文」 | full | plan mode | 使用者需要互動式引導，不是直接產出 |
| 「第一次寫論文」/「論文新手」 | full | plan mode | 新手需要蘇格拉底式逐章引導 |

### Plan to Full Mode Conversion Protocol

When a user completes `plan` mode and wants to proceed to `full` mode for actual paper writing:

#### Conversion Checklist

| Plan Mode Output | Full Mode Input | Conversion Action |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Chapter Plan (structure outline) | `structure_architect` agent | Map chapters → formal sections with heading levels; validate against `paper_structure_patterns.md` |
| Socratic Responses (Q&A transcripts) | `argument_builder` agent | Extract claims + evidence + warrants from dialogue; discard conversational scaffolding |
| Literature Notes (if any) | `literature_strategist` agent | Independent execution — plan mode notes serve as seed keywords only; full systematic search required |
| Argument Sketches | `argument_builder` agent | Evaluate each sketch against 4-level scoring; only `adequate` or above proceed |

#### Quality Gate

Before conversion, ALL of the following must be true:
- [ ] Every chapter in the Chapter Plan has at least 1 argument sketch rated `adequate` or above
- [ ] The overall paper structure maps to a recognized pattern in `paper_structure_patterns.md`
- [ ] At least 5 potential references have been identified (seeds for `literature_strategist`)
- [ ] The research question is finalized (not still evolving from Socratic dialogue)

#### What Gets Discarded
- Conversational filler from Socratic dialogue (greetings, confirmations, repetitions)
- Tentative ideas explicitly marked as "maybe" or "not sure" by the user
- Plan mode's iterative drafts (only the final version of each chapter plan carries over)
