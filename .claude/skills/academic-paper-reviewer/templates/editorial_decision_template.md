## Format Guidelines

### Revision Roadmap Design Principles

1. **Actionability**: Every item is a concrete task, not an abstract suggestion
2. **Traceability**: Every item can be traced back to specific reviewer comments
3. **Prioritization**: Priority 1 > 2 > 3; authors can process in order
4. **Time estimation**: Helps authors plan their revision timeline
5. **Compatibility**: Format can be directly used as `academic-paper` revision mode input

### Severity-to-Priority Mapping

| Severity | Priority | Revision Type |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| Critical | P1 | Required Revision |
| Major | P1/P2 | Required / Strongly Suggested |
| Minor | P2/P3 | Suggested |
| Cosmetic | P3 | Optional |
